# Introduction

Clearcoin is a cryptocurrency price tracking application meant to make price tracking more accessible and less overwhelming.

---

# Objectives

My main object was to create a full-stack cryptocurrency price tracking app that was not as overwhelming as some of the larger price tracking applications out there. I aimed to solve the horrendous load times some of those apps faced, as well as make it more friendly to people who may be just getting into the space.

# Who is this for? 

This is for the average person who may be intimidated by some of the larger-scale cryptocurrency price tracking applications but also has some nice features for the  average cryptocurrency investor that wants live price tracking without committing to making any sort of purchase.
